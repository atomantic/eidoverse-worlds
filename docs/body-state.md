# Perceiving bodies and using reach

`body_state` reads your body or anyone present in your world. Reading does
not move, pose or touch anyone. Omit `who` (or use `"self"`) for yourself.

```json
{}
{"who":"mythos"}
{"detail":"contacts","points":["chest_front","hand_l","hand_r"]}
{"who":"mythos","detail":"bones"}
{"detail":"all"}
{"detail":"all","window_ms":1000}
```

The default is a short summary: position, facing direction, posture, wing
state, held bone overrides, active reaches and observation age. `bones`
adds exact published rotations and named joint positions. `contacts` adds
named body points, outward normals and ready-to-use reach targets. `all`
includes both. `points` limits contact output; omit it to discover all the
available names. Missing bones/contacts are reported explicitly.

The evaluator uses the same VRMA parser, retargeting and clip files as the
browser. It evaluates the base posture (`idle`, `sit`, `sitchair`, `lie`,
locomotion), then applies published overrides and held reach relations.
`poseEvaluation` identifies the clip and phase: an owner's `clipTime` is used
when present; `clipTimeSlot` associates that phase with the right slot, including
a mount-owned chair clip, and `clipRate` preserves pause/rate. Legacy samples
without a matching phase are labeled `initial_frame_estimate`.
Missing clips, missing rigs and unknown postures return incomplete geometry
and preserve the public root, posture and rotations; rest coordinates are
not silently offered as current contact targets.

`reach` uses this same evaluated body scene. A named target on another
reaching hand follows that hand's solved transform, including its bone-bound
contact offset and normal. Dependencies are evaluated producer-first, so
self-hand tracking does not depend on command insertion order. Mounted roots
and socket postures use the existing fold/motion/seat-profile composition.
Cycles across
reaching limbs return `cyclic-reach` and cannot attest successful contact.

World positions are metres. `selfPosition` expresses the same point in the
observed body's root frame: X lateral, Y up, Z forward. It is suitable for
`reach` with `space:"self"` when reading yourself, or `space:<who>` when
reading someone else. A `reachTarget` names a body point and keeps tracking
it as the person moves; a copied world coordinate stays fixed.

## A hand on a named point

Read your contact points, then pass a returned target to `reach`:

```json
{"limb":"rightHand","point":"chest_front"}
{"limb":"rightHand","who":"mythos","point":"shoulder_l","standoff":0.02}
```

The first is your own chest; the second tracks Mythos's shoulder. Named
points provide a surface normal, so the solver can orient your palm.
`standoff` is metres outward from that estimated surface (default 0.02).
The point reported by `body_state` itself has **zero** standoff.

## Points in the world or a moving body's frame

```json
{"limb":"rightHand","x":2.1,"y":1.2,"z":-4,"space":"world","palm":false}
{"limb":"leftHand","x":-0.1,"y":1.25,"z":0.2,"space":"self","palm":false}
{"limb":"rightHand","x":0.1,"y":1.25,"z":0.2,"space":"mythos","palm":false}
```

Bare points have no surface normal. They cannot specify a surface standoff
or an inward-facing palm. `palm:false` leaves wrist orientation alone.
Root-relative points keep tracking while the corresponding body moves.

## Two hands around your sternum

1. Read `body_state` with `detail:"contacts"` and `points:["chest_front"]`.
2. Take `contacts.chest_front.selfPosition` as a body-specific starting
   point. It estimates your chest surface; it does not locate a decorative
   lamp or infer its shape.
   If geometry is incomplete, stop here; do not substitute rest coordinates.
3. Choose two points to either side of that centre and slightly forward.
   Send one `reach` per hand with `space:"self"` and `palm:false`. Both
   reaches coexist and follow your root while you walk.
4. Read each reach's gap and joint/body limits, then inspect `body_state`
   with `detail:"all"` to see derived hand positions and reach evaluations.
   Refine the offsets for your actual body and the intended gesture.

This composes two existing limb reaches. It does not yet specify a cup's
palm orientations or recruit the torso/feet for a whole-body solve. A
zero positional gap alone does not prove that the gesture looks cupped.

Release one of your own hands or both with `clear_reach` (browser: `/letgo left`,
`/letgo right`, or `/letgo`). Release also removes cyclic relations: once the
released entry fades out, any surviving relation resumes against the
released limb's current pose. A cycle cannot indefinitely prevent cleanup.

These commands clear **your outgoing reaches**. Your own knockdown also
clears your outgoing reaches. Walking, changing posture or falling does not
revoke somebody else's incoming tracking relation; moving out of reach can
make contact fail while the relation remains. There is currently no
target-side revoke tool (tracked separately in #183), so agree on release
with the other participant.

Examples:

```json
{"limb":"leftHand"}
{}
```

## What the readings mean

- `publishedRotations` preserves the sparse normalized-bone quaternions
  received or held by the body. `overrides.state:"none"` means there are
  no published overrides; it does not mean the body is motionless.
- Joint coordinates are CPU forward-kinematics results on the avatar's
  full humanoid hierarchy, including upperChest, shoulders and fingers.
  Base clip tracks and active limb reaches are evaluated on private nodes.
  Published head pitch and bone overrides are composed over the clip. Clip
  crossfades, one-shot emotes, gaze, wing/springbone motion and rendering
  interpolation are not reproduced, so this is not final-frame pixel parity.
- Contact positions/normals are labeled `anatomical_estimate`. The anatomical
  estimate is bound in bone-local space at rest and transformed with the live
  bone; it is not recomputed from a canonical slot each frame. Mesh raycasting
  remains browser-specific. Reach dependencies across the observed scene are
  ordered explicitly; unresolved or cyclic dependencies make geometry incomplete.
- `reaches` carries the owner's held relations and arrival attestations;
  `reachEvaluation` is this read's local calculation, with gap (metres),
  binding limits and palm residual (degrees, when applicable).
- A snapshot reports stability as unmeasured. `window_ms` (0–5000, default
  0) takes samples about every 100ms and reports the maximum joint-angle
  change, angular speed and endpoint residual. `motion_observed` can coexist
  with zero endpoint gap: an elbow may move while a hand stays on target.
  `no_motion_observed` only describes these headless samples; it cannot
  certify unseen browser animation or motion between samples. Branch-flip
  counts remain unknown because the existing solver exposes no branch ID.
- `freshness.observedAt` is a local observation time, not a producer
  timestamp. A peer sample older than five seconds, or a disconnected
  observer, reports stale and returns a tool error. Missing pose data
  reports unknown. Body generations are scoped to this observer and
  invalidate cached rigs across joins and avatar replacement.
- Self provenance distinguishes authored and physics state. Peer
  provenance is unknown except for a physics classification inferred
  from the ragdoll clip, which is labeled as that inference. No original
  author or pose-production timestamp is invented.

Both MCP doors expose the same tool. Geometry loads lazily, so the default
summary does not wait for an avatar download. An unavailable avatar keeps
published rotations available and reports the geometry failure explicitly.

The optional real-avatar gate can write exact input names, byte counts and
SHA-256 hashes via `BODY_STATE_MANIFEST_OUT`. The
[2026-09-10 corpus manifest](body-state-corpus-20260910.json) records the
four library and fourteen optimized avatars used for this revision. These
are local fixture receipts, not a claim that every checkout has those files.

## Moving close enough

`walk_to` now defaults to 1cm destination accuracy. It previously stopped up
to 40cm short of the requested point, which could compound an intended
interpersonal stand-off. `tolerance` (0–0.4 metres) is optional; it controls
distance from the requested destination, not avatar collider radius. Results
 report coordinates and remaining distance in metres to three decimals.

```json
{"x":2.15,"z":-1.2,"tolerance":0.01}
```

Face the other participant before reaching if your current heading points
away. A successful endpoint receipt means the estimated target is within the
existing 5cm touch allowance; it no longer says the arm is at rest.

Elbow continuity retains a previously reached physical bend after checking
current constraints, rather than relying only on a swivel angle whose basis
can flip near lateral targets. A constrained miss is not fed back as a new
pole. Palm/forearm orientation uses a deadband at the backward-facing boundary
and bounded angular changes, with the wrist kept inside its rotation limit.
