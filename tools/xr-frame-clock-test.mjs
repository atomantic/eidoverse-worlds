// xr-frame-clock-test — who owns window.requestAnimationFrame across a session (#197 review B2).
//
// This is the teardown/re-entry half of the session lifecycle, and it needs no renderer and no real
// XRSession: the shim touches exactly three members (requestAnimationFrame, cancelAnimationFrame,
// and an 'end' that flips a latch), so the stand-in below cannot invent product shape — there is
// almost no shape to invent. The compile/curtain/pose half is disclosed headset-only in the PR body.
//
// Run: BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH=0 bun tools/xr-frame-clock-test.mjs
//
// Mutations that must turn a named check red:
//   xr_frame_clock.js: captureNative re-captures every entry (the shim becomes "native")
//   xr_frame_clock.js: the shim ignores the ended latch (frames go to a dead session)
//   xr_frame_clock.js: the shim stops catching a throwing session
//   xr_frame_clock.js: cancel reaches only one clock
//   xr_frame_clock.js: shouldShim ignores the emulator (IWER feeds its own clock)
//   xr.js: the restore listener is registered AFTER setSession (three's own listener wins)
