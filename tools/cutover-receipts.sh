# THE VIEWPORT MATRIX, actually run (antra-tess #185). The knobs existed and no
# command exercised them, so the resize phase and the chrome/occlusion check were
# capabilities rather than receipts — the same gap as a corpus row nothing applies.
# 390x844 was held out while "stand" was covered by #earbtn — a known-red command
# in the shared receipts script blocks unrelated cutovers. ENABLED 2026-09-12: the
# default-size clamp (emotebar.js show()) opens the bar at the width that FITS, so
# on a phone it comes up 6 wide and two rows at x=110, clear of the mic/ear pair.
# Measured ok with AND without touch emulation; the occlusion cleared as a side
# effect of sizing rather than by moving anything.

# 1024x800 is NOT here for the same reason as 390x844: it fails today, and the
# defect PREDATES this branch — bef5311 (the head of the 05:32Z review) fails
# identically with `emotes [336,10,688,56] x world [609,8,1016,381]`. Cause:
# fitsDefaults sums chat(545)+world(407)=952 for the side-by-side test but
# EXCLUDES emotes, whose x is 'center' rather than a number — so a 352px centred
# strip is never counted. Below ~968 the predicate hides the bar and saves us;
# above ~1192 the geometry separates on its own; 1000-1100 is unprotected and no
# receipt or corpus row sat between 900 and 1200. ENABLED 2026-09-12 with the
# fitsDefaults centred-strip term (e6d9252): 1024x800 prints ok.
