// A lamp inside a SKINNED body is located through the SKELETON, not by
// rotating its bind-pose centre (client/lib/lightrig.js worldPosOf).
//
// Janus: "there seems to be a directional bias to the light. if i face in a
// different direction, it hits mostly my left wing, and in another, mostly
// right wing, etc." Measured on the live body while turning in place, the
// light swept 0.34m in x and 0.36m in z -- orbiting its own mean by ~0.17m,
// inside a chest cavity about 0.2m deep.
//
// THE CAUSE. attachLamps stores the emissive mesh's bounding-sphere centre as
// `offset`, and worldPosOf did:
//
//     worldPos(obj) + offset.applyQuaternion(worldQuat(obj))
//
// correct for a rigid object with a small local offset. But a SkinnedMesh's
// node sits at the body root while its vertices are in BIND-POSE coordinates,
// so that centre is an ABSOLUTE (0, 1.47, 0.0155) -- the full height off the
// floor. Rotating a 1.47m vector by body yaw rides the light around an arc.
// Yaw hid the worst of it (the offset is nearly vertical); a pitched body
// would throw the light clear of the body entirely.
//
// Uses a REAL THREE.Skeleton, not a stub: the defect is in the interaction
// between bind-space geometry and bone matrices, and a stub skeleton would
// have let the broken form pass.
