// capsule-recovery-test — the capsule is a FLOOR, not a verdict (#196 review B1).
//
// The review's required evidence: a product-path test proving fail → capsule → SAME body recovery,
// including same-path remote reannouncement and authority takeover. Drives the REAL
// client/lib/remotes.js (renderer-side imports stubbed; the recovery logic itself is the product).
//
// Run: BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH=0 bun tools/capsule-recovery-test.mjs
//
// Each of these mutations of the PRODUCT must turn a named check red:
//   remotes.js: never set `r.capsuleFor` on the fallback    → nothing knows a debt is owed
//   remotes.js: `retryBody` body removed (early return)     → the debt is never paid
//   remotes.js: same-path reannounce stops calling retryBody → the reannounce path stays terminal
//   remotes.js: takeover drops `fresh.capsuleFor`            → takeover makes the substitution permanent
//   remotes.js: drop the POST-load `remotes.get(id) !== r`   → a mid-flight body lands on a superseded record
//
// Two mutants SURVIVE this suite and are declared, not hidden:
//   • dropping the PRE-load guard (top of the timer) — EQUIV here: every scenario that supersedes
//     during the backoff is caught one line later by the post-load guard, which this suite does bind.
//     It is belt-and-braces against a supersede between timer fire and the first await.
//   • RETRY_MAX 3 → 9999 — not distinguishable inside a sane test window: the backoff
//     (400/1600/5000 ms) is what limits attempts over ~5 s, not the cap. Measured 09-19: a dead
//     asset yields retries 1→2→3 and attempts 1→3 under BOTH values. Killing it would need a
//     ~15 s test; the cap's observable (counter stops, further announces arm nothing) is bound
//     instead, which is what the product promises.
