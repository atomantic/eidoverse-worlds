# shared/ — modules every runtime folds with

One copy of the facts. Everything in this directory is imported verbatim by
all three species of runtime — the browser client (native ESM over HTTP at
`/shared/…`), the sequencer (Bun, from disk), and the mcpl agent — so shared
derivations (time of day, weather segments, particle meaning, and eventually
the whole fold) come out of exactly one function everywhere. The "fold is
sacred / mirrored math stays mirrored" house rules in AGENTS.md are true by
construction only for code that lives here; moving a mirrored pair into this
directory is how the rule is retired.

Constraints, on purpose:

- **Pure and dependency-free.** No three, no DOM, no Bun APIs, no
  `Date.now()` of its own — callers pass `now`. If it can't run in all three
  runtimes untouched, it doesn't belong here.
- **Plain JS + JSDoc types, no build step.** The browser imports these files
  as-is (the no-build doctrine holds); Bun's TS imports them directly. Type
  safety comes from `tsc --noEmit` over JSDoc, not from a compile.
- **Client code imports via `../../shared/…`** (from `client/lib/`): that
  path resolves to the repo root on disk (so headless tools can import client
  modules) and clamps to `/shared/…` in the browser (URLs don't ascend past
  root). The server route for `/shared/` serves this directory with the same
  no-store policy as client code.

Residents: `forecast.js` (day clock, weather policy, the sky fold),
`particles.js` (the `particles` component's meaning), `residency.js` (the
`residency` component's meaning — which hosting system lives in a world, which
agents it fields, and what the log says they actually did; see
`../residency/README.md`), and `fold.js` — the
reference fold of the protocol itself (`foldEntry`, `emptyState`,
`ROLE_RANK`, with `LogEntry`/`WorldState` as JSDoc typedefs), conformance-
tested by `bun tools/foldfix-test.ts` against `spec/fixtures/`. The browser
client's `applyEntry` adopts it with the state/realize skeleton
(TEL0S_NOTES.md §8 step 3).
