// shared/reach.js — two-bone inverse kinematics, bounded by the joint limits
// the ragdoll already measures.
//
// Why analytic and not CCD/FABRIK: a shoulder-elbow-hand chain is two links,
// and two links have a closed form. Iterative solvers buy generality this
// chain does not need and pay for it in jitter (they converge differently from
// different starting poses) and in nondeterminism across clients — and in this
// world EVERY client solves the same reach independently, so two clients that
// iterate differently draw two different arms. A closed form is the same
// arm everywhere, every frame, with no starting-state memory.
//
// Why the limits come from ragdoll.js's tables (moved to shared/joints.js):
// an arm that can reach where it could never fall is two different bodies. The
// cone, the frontal-plane stop and the elbow hinge are MEASURED numbers with
// comments explaining what each one cost to find; this module is a consumer of
// them, never a second opinion.
//
// Pure: arrays of numbers in, arrays of numbers out. No three, no scene graph,
// no bone objects — the caller measures the skeleton and converts the answer
// back into rotations, because that conversion is renderer-shaped and this is
// not. (Same split as motioneval.js.)

// naturally against the side is then "penetrating" and gets pushed off, and
// anything that needs contact (a hand on your own hip) cannot be reached:
// measured, the guards alone cost 80-190mm of reach on hip_l, and 228 -> 41mm
// on msaligned. Real arms rest against real bodies.
//
// The artefact worth preventing is the limb passing THROUGH the body — its

// Without it, torsoRadius (0.42x the wider of shoulder or hip span, a
