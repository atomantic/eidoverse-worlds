// rightsfold — what a folded world says an identity may do, as one function
// both runtimes can call.
//
// This is the precedence rule out of server/rights.ts, and it lives here
// because THREE places needed it and two of them had reimplemented it by hand:
// the sequencer (authoritative), the browser (its own HUD + the flight gate),
// and the mcpl agent. Each hand-rolled merge was a chance to disagree with the
// authority, and two of them took it -- the browser erased its own `fly` with
// a partial grant, and the agent never updated at all until reconnect.
//
// PURE, per shared/README.md: the admin override stays in server/rights.ts
// because WORLD_ADMIN is an environment fact, not a world fact, and it reaches
// a client only as an already-computed `yourRights` in the snapshot.
//
// The rule, verbatim from rights.ts and verified against it by test:
//   - a world with no owner is OPEN: builder + gen, and NEVER fly
//   - otherwise a name-keyed record wins over the wildcard `*`
//   - a name-keyed grant bound to a sub is worn only by that sub
//   - gen is implied by owner; fly is implied by nothing
//   - the caption deed ({id, born}) is implied by nothing either: it is the
//     one additional authoring act a visitor may hold, for one entity

  // deed, but also gen and fly, went to the wildcard default after a rename).
