// Who owns window.requestAnimationFrame while a session presents — as pure state. xr.js installs and
// restores it; this owns the rules. tools/xr-frame-clock-test.mjs drives them. No imports on purpose.
//
// While presenting, frames must come from the SESSION's clock, not the window's: a headset runs at its
// own rate and the window clock is throttled or stopped behind it. So window.rAF is shimmed onto the
// session for the session's duration, and restored at teardown.
//
// Three things make this sharp rather than cosmetic (#197 review B2):
//
//  • RESTORE ORDERING. three registers its OWN 'end' listener inside setSession, and that listener
//    restarts the desktop loop through window.requestAnimationFrame. If our restore has not run by
//    then, the restart goes to the dead session and NO FRAME EVER TICKS AGAIN (xr.js, 09-07 22:41:
//    after-exit frames+0 at +0.5 s AND +3 s). Our restore therefore has to be registered BEFORE
//    setSession, so it runs first.
//  • THE LATCH. Between 'end' firing and the restore completing, a caller can still reach the shim.
//    `sessionEnded` makes it fall through to the native clock instead of a dead session.
//  • RE-ENTRY. The saved native functions must survive one session and still be correct for the next.
//    Saving them twice (once per entry) captures the SHIM as "native" on the second entry and the
//    desktop loop never comes back — the failure the save-once rule exists to prevent.
//
// An emulated runtime (IWER) drives the session clock ON window.rAF, so shimming would feed it to
// itself (bench crash, 09-07 19:15). `shouldShim` says so.

/** Save the window's own clock exactly once per page, never per entry. */

  if (saved) return saved;   // already ours: a second capture would save the SHIM as native
  return { raf: win.requestAnimationFrame.bind(win), caf: win.cancelAnimationFrame.bind(win) };
}

 *  the product never installs the shim on any real runtime — while every source check (imports it,
 *  calls it, passes the saved pair, before setSession) still matched, and the suite stayed at 38/38.
 *
 *  The argument construction is therefore no longer at the call site. `enterVR` passes the objects it
 *  has (window, session, the saved pair) and THIS decides what `emulated` means, so a test can prove
 *  that a real runtime — one with no IWER — actually gets a shim.
