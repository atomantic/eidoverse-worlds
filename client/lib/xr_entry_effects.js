// WHO ACTS ON AN ENTRY FAILURE — the effect owner for the busy/absent/reload verdicts.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#197 round-two review, 2026-09-20): xr_entry_policy.js decides what a failure
// MEANS and is fully tested; the acting on it lived inline in xr.js and was covered only by source
// assertions — imports present, `verdict.delayMs` referenced, a cancel call in leaveVR. The reviewer
// mutated the shipping branch to `if (true)` so EVERY busy verdict scheduled a retry, including
// give-up, and the suite still passed 31/31. Regex-checking that code exists is not running it.
//
// So the effects move here, behind injected dependencies, and the suite drives THIS — the same
// module xr.js imports. Mutating the scheduling logic now turns the suite red because the suite
// executes it.
//
// State is per-owner rather than module-global so a test can hold two independent entry owners, and
// so nothing leaks between page sessions.

/** THE FAILURE SEAM ITSELF — decide, act, and say what the caller must do next.
 *
 *  #197 round-three review: the effects were importable and well tested, but the CALL SITE was not.
 *  The reviewer rewrote the shipping line as
 *      const did = false ? entryEffects.apply(...) : 'surface';
 *  which keeps the text `entryEffects.apply(...)` for every source regex while disabling retry,
 *  absence and reload entirely — and the suite stayed at 35/35. Extracting the effects moved the
 *  untested boundary one layer out; it did not remove it.
 *
 *  So the boundary itself is now a function. `enterVR`'s catch does nothing but call this and obey
 *  the returned instruction, and the suite drives THIS — the same function the product runs,
 *  including the argument construction (`isRetry` from retryOf, `gpu` from the backend) that the
 *  reviewer's other mutation targeted.
 *
 *  @returns 'handled' (the effect owns what happens next — return) | 'throw' (surface to the outer
 *           catch) | 'reload' (the caller performs the navigation, which needs `location`) */
